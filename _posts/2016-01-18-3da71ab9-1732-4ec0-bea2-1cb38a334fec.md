A collection of  images by Danish photographer - Mark Wessel.

Based in Copenhagen - Mark enjoys taking pictures of landscapes, portraits & fashion. With a history in the fashion business in the 1980Â´ties as an international model - he started working behind the camera, and quickly found that this was his main interest in life.

"All forms of beauty in life interest me a great deal, and freezing some of these moments in time - for others to enjoy - is important to me." - Mark Wessel.
